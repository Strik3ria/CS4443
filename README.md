# CS-4443 - Web-based Software Development - Troy University - RC

I am making this repo so that I can more efficiently share my work with the class.

### Historical knowledge

This will also allow me to refer back to my TODO files to see what my thought process was.

### Pull Requests

I am also going to use this as an opportunity to learn more about branching and making pull requests.
