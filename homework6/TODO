19.8 Write a PHP script that tests whether an e-mail
        address is input correctly. Verify that the input
        begins with series of characters, followed by
        the @ character, another series of characters,
        a period (.) and a final series of characters. Test
        your program, using both valid and invalid e-mail addresses.

19.9 Write a PHP script that obtains a URL and its
        description from a user and stores the information
        into a database using MySQL. Create and run a SQL
        script with a database named URL and a table named
        Urltable. The first field of the table should contain
        an actual URL, and the second, which is named Description,
        should contain a description of the URL. Use
        www.deitel.com as the first URL, and input Cool site!
        as its description. The second URL should be www.php.net,
        and the description should be The official PHP site.
        After each new URL is submitted, print the contents
        of the database in a table. [Note: Follow the instructions
        in Section 18.5.2 to create the Url database by
        using the URLs.sql script that’s provided with this
        chapter’s examples in the dbscripts folder.]
