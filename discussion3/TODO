6.19 Write a script that gets from the user the radius
of a circle and outputs HTML5 text that displays the
circle’s diameter, circumference and area. Use the
constant value 3.14159 for… Use the GUI techniques
shown in Fig. 6.7. [Note: You may also use the predefined
constant Math.PI for the value of π. This constant is more
precise than the value 3.14159. The Math object is
defined by JavaScript and provides many common mathematical
capabilities.] 

Use the following formulas (r is the radius): 
    diameter = 2r, 
    circumference = 2πr, 
    area = πr2.
